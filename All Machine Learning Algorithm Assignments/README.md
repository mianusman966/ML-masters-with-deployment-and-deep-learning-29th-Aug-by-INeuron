# All-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
Machine Learning Assignments of inuroun academy ML with master deployment and deep learning 29th aug. 2020
## 1. Linear Regression

Build the linear regression model using scikit learn in boston data to predict
'Price' based on other dependent variable.
## 2. Logistics Regression

I decided to treat this as a classification problem by creating a new binary
variable affair (did the woman have at least one affair?) and trying to
predict the classification for each woman.
## 3. KNN

In this assignment, students will be using the K-nearest neighbors
algorithm to predict how many points NBA players scored in the 2013-2014
season.
A look at the data
Before we dive into the algorithm, letâ€™s take a look at our data. Each row in
the data contains information on how a player performed in the 2013-2014
NBA season.
## 4. Decision Tree

Predicting Survival in the Titanic Data Set
We will be using a decision tree to make predictions about the Titanic data
set from Kaggle. This data set provides information on the Titanic
passengers and can be used to predict whether a passenger survived or
not.
## 5. XGBoost

In this assignment students need to predict whether a person makes over
50K per year or not from classic adult dataset using XGBoost. The
description of the dataset is as follows:
## 6. Random Forest

In this assignment students will build the random forest model after
normalizing the variable to house pricing from boston data set.
## 7. Classification
> Problem 1:
Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.

> Problem 2:
Which factors are important

> Problem 3:
Which algorithms are best for this dataset
## 8. Clustering

In this assignment students have to compress racoon grey scale image into
5 clusters. In the end, visualize both raw and compressed image and look
for quality difference.

The raw image is available in spicy.misc package with the name face.

**Hint:**

import numpy as np
from sklearn import cluster, datasets
from scipy import misc
## 9. Cluster project
>Problem 1:
There are various stocks for which we have collected a data set, which all stocks are
apparently similar in performance

>Problem 2:
How many Unique patterns that exist in the historical stock data set, based on
fluctuations in price.

>Problem 3:
Identify which all stocks are moving together and which all stocks are different from
each other.

## 10. Predicting players rating 
In this project you are going to predict the overall rating of soccer player based on their attributes such as 'crossing', 'finishing etc. 

The dataset you are going to use is from European Soccer Database (https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer) has more than 25,000 matches and more than 10,000 players for European professional soccer seasons from 2008 to 2016.
